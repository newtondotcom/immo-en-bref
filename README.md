üè° the website for a real estate journalist

The website is based on [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js?tab=readme-ov-file) to write articles. It features a real time editor which gives a direct preview on the article.

## Architecture

Using [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js?tab=readme-ov-file), the novice user can edit this article. Once they are done, the article (under the `json` format) will be saved to their Github account using Github's API and will also be saved on the server current runtime.
